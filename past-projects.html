          </div>
          <br>
          <p>This was my final year project where I developed a AI based chatbot which was able to send actions to a seperate device which contained LED lights and temperature sensors.</p>
          <p>The chatbot engine was a web based engine called DialogFlow by Google. It acted as a bridge between the device operatin the chatbot application to the device containing hte LEDs.</p>
          <p>The communication between the devices was made by sending JSON files from DialogFlow to the smart home device (Raspberry Pi).</p>

            <h2><u>Three.js Scene</u></h2>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>This project was a produced by a team of 4. It used the JavaScript library Three.js to implement models created using 3DS Max in order to load a 3D visual simulation.</p>
          <p>Our scene consisted of various buildings found in  a town or city in order to simulate the town environment and the camera would focus on an autonomous car which would navigate through the landscape using roads which we designed. the car would also stop at traffic lights we placed throughout the scene.</p>

            <h2><u>Collaborative Web Design Project</u></h2>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>A group of 6 of us created a web application which would aid the user in retrieving information from the University of Wolverhampton website.</p>
          <p>There were a total of 4 roles involved in the project which consisted of:</p>
          <ul class="collab">
            <li>Project Manager</li>
            <li>Business Analyst</li>
            <li>Database Engineer</li>
            <li>3 Developers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As a developer, I was responsible for the progression of the coding aspects of the project. This included HTML, CSS and PHP script writing along with including elements from the SQL database in order to link the website to the database.</p>
          <p>The project simulated a business style project by splitting the process up into two sprints. We also had two meetings a week to discuss progress made and used GitHub for version control.</p>
